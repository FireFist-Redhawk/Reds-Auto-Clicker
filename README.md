# Reds-Auto-Clicker

Red's Auto Clicker is an open-source process automation tool that allows you to create macros consisting of many types of possible actions. Tedious processes can be automated with fine-grain control over the timing of each individual step. If you find this tool useful, please consider starring the repo to show your support. If you find a bug or would like to make a suggestion, [create an issue](https://github.com/FireFist-Redhawk/Reds-Auto-Clicker/issues/new/choose) to let me know about it.
