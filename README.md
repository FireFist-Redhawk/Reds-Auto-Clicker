# Reds-Auto-Clicker

My first open-source project! Install the dependencies, look through the code, and learn a little about LabVIEW if you want. If you start getting dangerous with it, feel free to add feature requests, or even add your own features and submit a pull request for me to review. Software development is a whole lot funner when it's paired with one's hobbies! Or if you'd rather just get going, simply go to the Releases page and download the installer for the compiled executable.
