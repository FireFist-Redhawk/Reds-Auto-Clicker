# Reds-Auto-Clicker

My first open-source project! Install the dependencies, look through the code, and learn a little about LabVIEW if you want. If you start getting dangerous with it, feel free to add feature requests, or even add your own features and submit a pull request for me to review. Software development is a whole lot funner when it's paired with one's hobbies!

Or if you'd rather just get going, simply go to the Releases page and download the installer for the compiled executable. Please Like, Follow, Subscribe to me on social media if you like using this tool, I will soon be making moves to create more content.
