# Reds-Auto-Clicker

My first open-source project! Download the code, install the dependencies, and learn a little about LabVIEW if you want! Add feature requests, add your own features and submit a pull request for me to review, explore the world of software development!Or simply go to the Releases page and download the installer for the compiled executable if you'd rather just get going. Please Like, Follow, Subscribe to me on social media if you like using this tool, I will soon be making moves to create more content.
